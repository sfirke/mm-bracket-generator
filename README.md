Shiny app to generate March Madness brackets

This would be a Shiny app version of this .Rmd file: https://github.com/sfirke/predicting-march-madness/blob/master/march_madness_how_to.Rmd

It would take a user's Kaggle March Madness predictions, or use a default set, and simulate a bracket.  User can enter a seed and/or upload their predictions.  Maybe they can specify a team to make it to a certain round, e.g., give me a bracket where Michigan St. wins it all.

Simple idea, but I didn't get it done in time for 2018.  Maybe in 2019?  In the meantime, anyone else is welcome to try this instead.  I thought it could be a fun 1st Shiny app.
